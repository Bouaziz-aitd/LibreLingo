Nongo (Where are you from?)\n\n## Nongo Case - Proper names\n\n*   Basque uses the nongo case to express relationships of place, time, destination and others. The exact meaning needs to be determined from context.\n*   The nongo case is only used with inanimate objects.\n*   For ownership by animate nouns, the genitive case is used: Mikelen liburua. Mikel’s book.\n*   When using a noun in the NONGO case to show where someone is from, “ex: I am from America.”\n*   an -a or -ak, must be added as described above for the NOR case, since it is the last/only item in the phrase.\n*   Ni Amerikakoa naiz. I am an American.\n*   When used for ownership, it doesn’t take a suffix. Iruneko bidea. The Irun road.\n*   To form the nongo case for proper nouns-ko/go is added to the end\n    \n    *   DonostiKO\n    *   IrunGO\n    \n    \n    \n*   Note that the -ko ending changes to -go after voiced consonants, except r (b,d,g,j,l,m,n,ng,sz,th,v,w,y,z)\n\n### Vocabulary Egon2 1\n\n*   Alemaniako: from Germany\n*   Espainiako: from Spain\n*   Gasteizeko: from Victoria\n*   Irungo: from Irun\n*   Donostiako: from San Sebastian\n*   bide: road\n*   nongoa: of/from which place?\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)"}}]);

Dative Commands 1\n\n## 31.1 NORI - Dative Case\n\n*   The NORI case answers the question “nori”( to whom), and is used to show the indirect object of an action,\n*   which is the person or thing that an action is done to or for.\n*   Like for non dative commands, the dictionary form of the verb comes first, then the direct object, then the indirect object.\n*   For example: Eman baloia hau hari. Give this ball to him/her.\n*   Note: in the following list of dative pronouns, the pronouns for "to you" and "to you (plural)" are not listed.\n*   This is because it doesn\'t make sense to say "You give the ball to you."\n\n### Dative Commands 1\n\n*   niri: to me\n*   hari: to him/her/it\n*   guri: to us\n*   haiei: to them\n*   entzun: listen\n*   ekarri: bring\n*   irakurri: read\n*   menu: menu\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)'}}]);

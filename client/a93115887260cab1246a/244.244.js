(He/she is a happy person.(normally happy))\n*   Hura pozik dago. (He/she is glad/happy. (now/to meet you/to see you,etc))\n*   To ask questions about the state of someone or something, the question word “nola” can be used.\n*   When we answer the question Nola? or Zer moduz? the appropriate verb is egon,\n*   since emotions and physical state are temporary, just as it is when discussing location.\n*   Words to describe the temporary state, such as: happy, sad, seated, angry, tired, etc. do not have case endings added to them.\n\n### Vocabulary 1\n\n*   aspertu: bored\n*   beldur: afraid\n*   bizirik: alive\n*   galdu: lost\n*   lanpetuta: busy\n*   pozik: glad,happy\n*   ondo: well/fine\n*   nola: How?\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)"}}]);

Are you Miren?\n\n### "al" question word\n\n*   Alternatively, you can be a bit more polite/formal and add "al" and ask "Miren al zara zu?"\n*   You also need to keep in mind that Basque sentences have the most important pronoun or noun before the verb.\n*   So "Zu irakaslea (al) zara?" ("al" optional) means "Are you a teacher?" with irakaslea/teacher stressed.\n*   In other words, I thought you were the janitor. :-)\n*   "Zu al zara irakaslea?" would be "Are you THE teacher?" with "zu" stressed or I thought the guy in a tie by the desk was the teacher. :-)\n\n### Interrogative questions\n\nInterrogative questions (as opposed to yes/no questions) use question words, such as:\n* Zer (what) and nor/nortzunk (who(single/plural)), and take the form of Question word * verb *\nsubject.\n* Nor zara zu?

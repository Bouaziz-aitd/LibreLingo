This section will cover the use compound verbs with intransitive verbs.\n*   The use of compound verbs with transitive verbs will be covered later.\n\n### Ahal Izan, Behar Izan and Ezin in the past tense\n\n*   Ahal Izan, Behar Izan and Ezin in the remote and near past.\n*   In the past form, the dictionary form of the verb is used, with ahal izan. behar izan or ezin,\n*   and the past(for far past) or present (for near past) form of the verb “izan”.\n*   As with normal non-declined verbs, far past is normally prior to that day and the near past is earlier that day.\n*   Remote Past: Atzo joan ahal izan nintzen. I could/was able to go yesterday.\n*   Near Past: Gaur joan ahal izan naiz. I could/was able to go today.\n*   Remote Past: Atzo joan behar izan nintzen.

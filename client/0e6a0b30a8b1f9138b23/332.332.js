So “go” is intransitive and uses IZAN.\n\n### Near past\n\n*   The near past is used for past actions in present time frame, usually earlier that day.\n*   It is formed with the perfect stem + present of“to be” (IZAN)\n*   Ni gaur iristi naiz. I arrived today.\n*   Note that bizi didn't have a near past as it doesn't make sense to have lived one place prior to today,\n*   another place this morning and yet another now.\n\n## Lesson 2 Vocabulary\n\n*   gaur today\n*   gaur goizean this morning\n*   goiz early\n*   garaiz on time\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)"}}]);

(not to someone else))\n*   but they will be used in the course to teach and reinforce the pronouns.\n*   The Sentence structure for dative sentences is normally Indirect object + Subject + (Direct Object) + main verb + dative from of the auxiliary verb,\n*   with the direct object only being present for transitive verbs.\n*   So the sentence structure for “(Zuri hura) gustatzen zaizu?” is the Indirect object: zuri (to you) + the Subject: hura(it)\n*   \n    \n    *   the main verb: gustatzen + the dative of the auxiliary verb: zaizu.\n    \n    \n    \n*   However, the order can be modified based on what the speaker wants to emphasis.\n*   For this verb, the item being liked can come before the verbs or after, but can’t come between,\n*   so I like coffee.(Coffee is pleasing to me.) can be “(Niri)Kafea gustatzen zait.” or “(Niri) Gustatzen zait kafea.”\n*   or for plural objects I like owls (Owls are pleasing to me.) (Niri)Hontzak gustatzen zaizkit or (Niri)gustatzen zaizkit hontzak.\n*   For negative sentences, the order is, again, changed and “ez” needs to be next to the conjugated verb.\n*   “(Niri) Ez zait gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Gustatzen ez zait.” (I don’t like it./It is not pleasing to me.)\n*   “(Niri) Ez zaizkit gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Gustatzen ez zaizkit.” (I don’t like them./They are not pleasing to me.).\n*   While “ez” and the verb must be together, other elements can be moved to show emphasis, so “I don’t like snakes./Snakes are not pleasing to me.” can be\n*   “(Niri) Sugeak ez zaizkit gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Ez zaizkit sugeak gustatzen.” or “(Niri) Ez zaizkit gustatzen sugeak.”\n*   Other reflective verbs that take the dative include: interesatu (interested in), kostatu (cost)), iruditu (seemed), berdin(same),gelditu (remained, left).\n\n## 32.1 Grammar: NORI Verb Construction (Dative)\n\n*   When intransitive verbs are used in the dative case, there are only normally only two (NOR) subjects used he/she/it, which have the prefix “za”\n*   or they, which has the prefix “zaizk”.\n*   A NORI suffix is then added to form the dative verb (to me -it, to you -izu, to him, her -io, to us -igu, to you (plural) -izue, to them -ie)\n*   Single indirect single object(za-)/Plural indirect plural object (zaizk-)\n*   niri zait/zaizkit\n*   zuri zaizu/zaizkizu\n*   hari zaio/zaizkio\n*   guri zaigu/zaizkigu\n*   zuei zaizue/zaizkizue\n*   haiei zaie/zaizkie\n\n### Reflective Verbs 1\n\n*   zuri: to you\n*   zuei: to you plural\n*   (niri) zait: it is to me\n*   (zuri) zaizu: it is to you\n*   (hari) zaio: it is to him/her/it\n*   (guri) zaigu: it is to us\n*   (zuei) zaizue: it is to you(plural)\n*   (haiei) zaie: it is to them\n*   gustatuko: will like (will be pleasing)\n*   gustatzen: like (is pleasing)\n*   gustatu: liked (was pleasing)\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)"}}]);

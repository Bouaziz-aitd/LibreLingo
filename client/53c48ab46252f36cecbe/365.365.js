I go by train.),\n*   to change nouns to adverbs(arreta care - arretaz carefully) and languages (euskaraz - in Basque).\n*   The indefinite form of the instrumental is used in numerous expressions, such as:\n*   Gauez ibiltzen naiz. I walk at night.\n*   Oinez joaten naiz. I go by foot.\n*   Liburua ingelesez dago. The book is in English.\n*   Seinaleak euskaraz daude. The signs are in Basque\n*   Note: Remember, the conjugated form of verbs, such as Etorri (nator, zatoz, dator, gatoz, zatozte, datoz)\n*   is the equivalent of the present continuous form in English, that being something you are in the process of doing, now or around now.\n*   “I am coming from school by bus.” (now) (Ni eskolatik autobusez nator.),\n*   while the non-conjugated form is used for things done habitually “I come from school every day by bus.” (Ni egunero etortzen naiz eskolatik autobusez.).\n*   Similarly, the past form of conjugated verbs represents the past continuous, “I was coming from school by bus.”(Eskolatik autobusez nentorren.).\n*   vs non-conjugated I came home from school by bus every day.(Egunero etortzen nintzen eskolatik autobusez.)\n\n### NORTAZ 1\n\n*   autobusez: by bus\n*   trenz: by train\n*   ferry: ferry\n*   ferryz: by ferry\n*   hegazkin: airplane\n*   hegazkinez: by airplane\n*   kamioi: truck\n*   kamioiz: by truck\n*   motor: motorcycle\n*   motorrez: by motorcycle\n*   astero: every week\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)"}}]);

Ukan/Edun 1-1\n\n## 33.1 Ukan - Ergative case/NORK\n\n*   There are two names for the auxiliary verb used for non-conjugated transitive verbs, Ukan and Edun.\n*   You will see one or the other or both in literature, but they refer to the same set of words.\n*   Transitive verbs are those that can answer the question “what”, and Ukan/Edun is used, throughout the region,\n*   as the auxiliary verb for transitive verbs, in a similar manner to how IZAN is used with non-transitive verbs.\n*   Ukan/Edun can also be used to mean “to have”, and is a synonym with Eduki, which is common in Spain, but seldom used in France.\n*   Eduki will be covered later\n\n### Auxiliary verb Ukan/Edun conjugated\n\n*   Ukan/Edun with a single object is du- with the endings -t, -zu, -. -gu, -zue, -te\n*   (nik dut, zuk duzu, hark du, guk dugu, zuek duzue, haiek dute)\n*   This is a pattern you will see with other conjugated transitive verbs.\n*   Verbs used with Ukan/Edun follow the same form as with Izan.\n*   For the near past, the dictionary form is combined with Ukan/Edun. For example Nik egin dut. I did it.\n*   Word order in Basque can be very flexible, but normally for transitive verbs it is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).\n*   As with intransitive verbs, when adjectives are used, they follow the noun,\n*   the noun doesn’t change and the grammar suffix is added to the last adjective in the noun phrase.\n*   Gaur nik poltsa urdina ireki dut. Today I opened the blue purse.\n*   Subject: Nik, Object: Noun: poltsa Adjective: urdina, Verb: Main Verb: ireki Auxiliary verb: dut.\n\n### Near past\n\n*   As with intrasitive, the near past is an event that happened in the present time from, usually that day\n*   for example: Guar nik euskaraz hitz egin dut.\n*   Today I spoke Basque.\n*   As with intransitive verbs, when used in the negative. Didn’t do something, ez goes with the noun.\n*   Nik ez dut liburua irakurri. I didn’t read the book.\n\n## The NORK case:\n\n*   The chart below shows the main parts of the NORK-NOR (ergative -absolutive) case in Basque.\n*   The NORK (ergative) case is used with the subject of transitive verbs (verbs which have objects)\n*   while the object of the verb is in the NOR (absolutive) case,\n*   which is the case used for the subject of intransitive verbs, that was covered earlier.\n*   Example: Txakurra gaztea da. The dog is young.(txakurra is the intransitive verb subject)\n*   Mikelek txakurra dauka. Michael has the dog.(txakurra is the transitive verb object, while Mikelek is the subject)\n\n### Nork Case\n\n*   Indefinite\n*   -(e)k\n*   mendik\n*   Single definite\n*   -ak\n*   mendiak\n*   Plural definite\n*   -ek\n*   mendiek\n*   Proper names\n*   -(e)k\n*   Mikelek\n\n### -rik\n\n*   As was covered in module 20, Because 1, the Basque word for any is the suffix -rik.\n*   When using -rik, you just add -rik to the no article form. Ex: diru = money, dirurik. = any money.\n*   As with English, -rik is normally used with negative sentences. The subject doesn’t have any of the object. Also note -rik makes the object single.\n\n### Ukan/Edun 1-1\n\n*   Note that the following are translated as have/has, but remember they also can be used as auxiliary verbs\n*   and that is how they will be used in this lesson for the sentences.\n*   Nik dut: I have (single object)\n*   Zuk duzu: You have (single object)\n*   Hark du: He/she/it has (single object)\n*   Guk dugu: We have (single object)\n*   Zuek duzue: You (plural) have (single object)\n*   Haiek dute: They have (single object)\n*   ireki: opened\n*   itxi: closed\n*   jaso: received\n*   garbitu: cleaned\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)"}}]);
